Only Smart Contracts are included in this folder. The complete documentation (incl. unit tests) is located in a private repository for reasons of confidentiality.
Once we have contacted you as an auditor, you will be given access to this private repository. If you have any questions, please contact us in the usual way (email or telegram).
